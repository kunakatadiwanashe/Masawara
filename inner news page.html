            dear masawara family
        </h2>
        <span>February 18th, 2020</span>
        <p>New season’s greetings to you all</p>
        <p>
            I wish that 2020 will be a year of tremendous growth for each of you as
            well as unprecedented development for the Masawara Group. The growth
            journey of our organization, as it will be measured over the next five
            years, will reflect transformational prosperity even in the face of all
            anticipated adversity. As you might have been updated by your leadership
            teams, the Masawara Group has commenced a growth trajectory that has been
            defined after a series of strategy formulation meetings that involved all
            the Masawara units at various levels. At our Masawara Leadership
            conference, we established the critical factors that will lead to a
            transformation of our organization. To achieve this transformation,
            we will invest in existing and new short to long term opportunities to
            create value for our shareholders whilst enhancing our responsibility to make the lives of everyone we touch
            better.

        </p>
        <p>
            Our strategy is simple. We will:
        </p>
        <p>
            Invest astutely to build leadership positions in five critical growth sectors i.e. Financial services,
            Hospitality, Agriculture, Health and Energy.
            Technology and Innovation
            Leverage technology-enabled innovation to create exceptional and ground-breaking products and services
            People and Culture
            Invest in our people by attracting, retaining and training our staff to give them to capacity to implement
            and deliver the growth strategy
            Marketing, Innovation and Customer Experience
            Establish the Masawara brand as a reflection of African ingenuity, innovation, and belief.
            Undeniably, such ambitions are far-reaching and challenging. However, I have no doubt in our ability to
            achieve these goals that I believe to be common to us all, as you have never lacked courage in the past.

        <p>As I reflect the commencement of this journey, my key deliverables are;</p>

        <p>
            To make sure that over the next five years there is no one in our group whose life will not be better while
            working at Masawara. With this in mind, the transformation team tasked with focusing on People and Culture
            will be working with all the companies in the Group to periodically carry out surveys on what you all wish
            to see incorporated into our structures to make your lives significantly better. The goal is that within
            five years, Masawara will be Zimbabwe’s most admired group and employer.
            Bearing the above in mind, I would like us to intensify our efforts with a focus on delivering the Masawara
            10x growth strategy. This shared vision will deliver returns to stakeholders within Masawara’s sphere of
            influence and amplify our presence nationally and regional wide.

            I am incredibly excited to embark on this journey with you and I hope you are just as excited for all that lies ahead of us!
